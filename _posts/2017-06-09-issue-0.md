Now that the holidays are over, things have started to pick up again on Swift.org. If you are following any of the repos on GitHub, you have probably noticed. I'm not sure how I missed this before, but this week I just discovered [SwiftExperimental.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift). For now, it defines a bunch of custom unicode operators for `Set`. It's really cool. I would love to see more APIs like this in the standard library. Anyway, here's the weekly brief!

### Article

[**Cheat Sheet of Machine Learning and Python (and Math) Cheat Sheets**](https://unsupervisedmethods.com/cheat-sheet-of-machine-learning-and-python-and-math-cheat-sheets-a4afe4e791b6)This post contains 27 of the better cheat sheets Iâ€™ve found on the web. Let me know if Iâ€™m missing any you like.
**This is the preparation for the followup tutorial series on ARM exploit development (not published yet). Before dive into creating ARM shellcode and build ROP chains, we need to cover some ARM Assembly basics first:**

- [Data Types Registers](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-data-types-and-registers-part-2/)

[**Managing resources for large-scale testing**](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1708075792818517/managing-resources-for-large-scale-testing/)A solution of facebook for testing hundreds of important interactions across numerous types of devices and operating systems for both correctness and speed before we ship new code.


### Video and Webinar

Matthew Johnson's [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md) to improve memberwise initializers is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000010.html). As Lattner [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151130/000518.html), there are a number of deficiencies with the current memeberwise initializer behavior in Swift. I have a good feeling this will be accepted.

The proposal to "require self for accessing instance members" has been (thankfully) [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000009.html). Some of the main reasons for this decision were that it (1) introduces verbosity rather than clarity, (2) diminishes the use of `self.` as an indicator for possible retain cycles, and (3) teams wishing to adopt this usage could simply enforce it with a linter.

Doug Gregor has submitted a [proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/generalized-naming/proposals/0000-generalized-naming.md) for *Generalized Naming for Any Function*. From the introduction: *"Swift includes support for first-class functions, such that any function (or method) can be placed into a value of function type. However, it is not possible to specifically name every function that is part of a Swift program &mdash; one cannot provide the argument labels when naming a function."* The lack of this feature is definitely a pain point in Swift, especially when working with Cocoa and Objective-C selectors. It's a short read!

### Threat News

Doug Gregor [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/005312.html) some surprising behavior when extending an `@objc` protocol &mdash; the members of the `extension` are not exposed to the Objective-C runtime. ðŸ˜³ Luckily, I haven't run into this bug myself.

### Tools

- [**Free tools for auditing the security of an AWS account**](https://summitroute.com/blog/2017/05/30/free_tools_for_auditing_the_security_of_an_aws_account/) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is generally secure by default, but can be misconfigured and the initial setup lacks enforcement of some best practices. This post provides a survey of the existing tools available to help you discover potential security improvements with AWS accounts.
- [**The DevOps Security Checklist**](https://devops-security-checklist.sqreen.io/) This security checklist aims to give DevOps professionals a list of security best practices they can follow according to their company stage.

### Books

And finally &mdash; is `?.` the ["call-me-maybe" operator](https://twitter.com/uint_min/status/683532142677114880) in Swift? **That's it for this week!**
