Now that the holidays are over, things have started to pick up again on Swift.org. If you are following any of the repos on GitHub, you have probably noticed. I'm not sure how I missed this before, but this week I just discovered [SwiftExperimental.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift). For now, it defines a bunch of custom unicode operators for `Set`. It's really cool. I would love to see more APIs like this in the standard library. Anyway, here's the weekly brief!

### Threat News

Doug Gregor [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/005312.html) some surprising behavior when extending an `@objc` protocol &mdash; the members of the `extension` are not exposed to the Objective-C runtime. ðŸ˜³ Luckily, I haven't run into this bug myself.

### Tools

- [**Free tools for auditing the security of an AWS account**](https://summitroute.com/blog/2017/05/30/free_tools_for_auditing_the_security_of_an_aws_account/) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is generally secure by default, but can be misconfigured and the initial setup lacks enforcement of some best practices. This post provides a survey of the existing tools available to help you discover potential security improvements with AWS accounts.
- [**The DevOps Security Checklist**](https://devops-security-checklist.sqreen.io/) This security checklist aims to give DevOps professionals a list of security best practices they can follow according to their company stage.

### Books

And finally &mdash; is `?.` the ["call-me-maybe" operator](https://twitter.com/uint_min/status/683532142677114880) in Swift? **That's it for this week!**
