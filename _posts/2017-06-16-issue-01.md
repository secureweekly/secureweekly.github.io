Now that the holidays are over, things have started to pick up again on Swift.org. If you are following any of the repos on GitHub, you have probably noticed. I'm not sure how I missed this before, but this week I just discovered [SwiftExperimental.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift). For now, it defines a bunch of custom unicode operators for `Set`. It's really cool. I would love to see more APIs like this in the standard library. Anyway, here's the weekly brief!

### Article

1. [**无服务器架构入门:**](http://blog.bingocloud.cn/archives/1642)这篇文章阐述了为什么我们认为，无服务器架构对软件开发人员和解决方案架构师来说是改变行业规则的技术。它介绍了 AWS Lambda 之类的关键服务，还介绍了无服务器架构的几个原则，帮助你了解什么造就真正的无服务器系统。

2. **This is the preparation for the followup tutorial series on ARM exploit development (not published yet). Before dive into creating ARM shellcode and build ROP chains, we need to cover some ARM Assembly basics first:**

3. [**Managing resources for large-scale testing**](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1708075792818517/managing-resources-for-large-scale-testing/)A solution of facebook for testing hundreds of important interactions across numerous types of devices and operating systems for both correctness and speed before we ship new code.

### Threat News

Doug Gregor [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/005312.html) some surprising behavior when extending an `@objc` protocol &mdash; the members of the `extension` are not exposed to the Objective-C runtime. 😳 Luckily, I haven't run into this bug myself.
