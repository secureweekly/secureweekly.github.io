Now that the holidays are over, things have started to pick up again on Swift.org. If you are following any of the repos on GitHub, you have probably noticed. I'm not sure how I missed this before, but this week I just discovered [SwiftExperimental.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift). For now, it defines a bunch of custom unicode operators for `Set`. It's really cool. I would love to see more APIs like this in the standard library. Anyway, here's the weekly brief!

### Article

1. [**REVERSE ENGINEERING GUIDE ON X86 ASSEMBLY:**]
- [PART 1 INTRO TO REGISTERS](http://infoseclina.blogspot.com/2017/06/reverse-engineering-guide-on-x86.html) Learning x86 assembly is critical when youâ€™re analysing malware, deconstructing executable files and developing your own exploits. However, before youâ€™re able to embark on this journey, itâ€™s crucial youâ€™re familiar with C and compilation.

2. **This is the preparation for the followup tutorial series on ARM exploit development (not published yet). Before dive into creating ARM shellcode and build ROP chains, we need to cover some ARM Assembly basics first:**

3. [**Managing resources for large-scale testing**](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1708075792818517/managing-resources-for-large-scale-testing/)A solution of facebook for testing hundreds of important interactions across numerous types of devices and operating systems for both correctness and speed before we ship new code.

### Threat News

Doug Gregor [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/005312.html) some surprising behavior when extending an `@objc` protocol &mdash; the members of the `extension` are not exposed to the Objective-C runtime. ðŸ˜³ Luckily, I haven't run into this bug myself.

### Tools

- [**How to implement an X509TrustManager using Frida**](https://gist.github.com/oleavr/3ca67a173ff7d207c6b8c3b0ca65a9d8)Use frida to implement an X509 TrustManager
- [**MalTrail: Malicious Traffic Detection System Tool**](https://blog.hackersonlineclub.com/2017/06/maltrail-malicious-traffic-detection.html) Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and custom user defined lists, where trail can be anything from domain name (e.g. zvpprsensinaix.[com] for Banjori malware), URL (e.g. http://109.162.38.120/harsh02.[exe] for known malicious executable), IP address (e.g. 185.130.5.231 for known attacker) or HTTP User-Agent header value (e.g. sqlmap for automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool).

### Books

And finally &mdash; is `?.` the ["call-me-maybe" operator](https://twitter.com/uint_min/status/683532142677114880) in Swift? **That's it for this week!**
