Now that the holidays are over, things have started to pick up again on Swift.org. If you are following any of the repos on GitHub, you have probably noticed. I'm not sure how I missed this before, but this week I just discovered [SwiftExperimental.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift). For now, it defines a bunch of custom unicode operators for `Set`. It's really cool. I would love to see more APIs like this in the standard library. Anyway, here's the weekly brief!

### Article

1. [**REVERSE ENGINEERING GUIDE ON X86 ASSEMBLY:**]
- [PART 1 INTRO TO REGISTERS](http://infoseclina.blogspot.com/2017/06/reverse-engineering-guide-on-x86.html) Learning x86 assembly is critical when you’re analysing malware, deconstructing executable files and developing your own exploits. However, before you’re able to embark on this journey, it’s crucial you’re familiar with C and compilation.

2. **This is the preparation for the followup tutorial series on ARM exploit development (not published yet). Before dive into creating ARM shellcode and build ROP chains, we need to cover some ARM Assembly basics first:**

3. [**Managing resources for large-scale testing**](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1708075792818517/managing-resources-for-large-scale-testing/)A solution of facebook for testing hundreds of important interactions across numerous types of devices and operating systems for both correctness and speed before we ship new code.

### Threat News

Doug Gregor [notes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/005312.html) some surprising behavior when extending an `@objc` protocol &mdash; the members of the `extension` are not exposed to the Objective-C runtime. 😳 Luckily, I haven't run into this bug myself.

### Tools

### Books

And finally &mdash; is `?.` the ["call-me-maybe" operator](https://twitter.com/uint_min/status/683532142677114880) in Swift? **That's it for this week!**
