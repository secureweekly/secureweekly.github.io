### Article
- [**Over 150 of the Best Machine Learning, NLP, and Python Tutorials**](https://unsupervisedmethods.com/over-150-of-the-best-machine-learning-nlp-and-python-tutorials-ive-found-ffce2939bd78) While machine learning has a rich history dating back to 1959, the field is evolving at an unprecedented rate. In a recent article, I discussed why the broader artificial intelligence field is booming and likely will for some time to come. Those interested in learning ML may find it daunting to get started.

- [**Super Awesome Fuzzing testing**](https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2017/06/22/super-awesome-fuzzing-part-one/) The point of security software is to make a system more secure. When developing software, one definitely doesn’t want to introduce new points of failure, or to increase the attack surface of the system the software is running on. So naturally, we take secure coding practices and software quality seriously.

### Tools

- [**RTFM**](https://github.com/leostat/rtfm) A database of common, interesting or useful commands, in one handy referable form, RTFM is a great and useful book, BUT a bit pointless when you have to transcribe it, so this little program will aim to be the spiritual successor to it.
- [**Python for penetration testers**](https://vulnerablelife.wordpress.com/2017/05/13/python-for-penetration-testers/) If you are involved in vulnerability research, reverse engineering or penetration testing, I suggest to try out the Python programming language. It has a rich set of useful libraries and programs. This page lists some of them.

Most of the listed tools are written in Python, others are just bindings for existing C libraries, i.e. they make those libraries easily usable from Python programs.

### Books
- [**Burp Suite 实战指南**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/t0data/burpsuite/details) 本书主要实践方面的使用介绍，内容主要源于BurpSuite官方文档和多位国外安全大牛的经验总结，我只是在他们的基础上，结合我的经验、理解和实践.
- [**An all-in-one beginner's guide to modern React application development**](http://www.react.express/)
