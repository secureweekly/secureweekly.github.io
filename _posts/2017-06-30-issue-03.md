### Article
- [**Over 150 of the Best Machine Learning, NLP, and Python Tutorials**](https://unsupervisedmethods.com/over-150-of-the-best-machine-learning-nlp-and-python-tutorials-ive-found-ffce2939bd78) While machine learning has a rich history dating back to 1959, the field is evolving at an unprecedented rate. In a recent article, I discussed why the broader artificial intelligence field is booming and likely will for some time to come. Those interested in learning ML may find it daunting to get started.

### Tools

- [**RTFM**](https://github.com/leostat/rtfm) A database of common, interesting or useful commands, in one handy referable form, RTFM is a great and useful book, BUT a bit pointless when you have to transcribe it, so this little program will aim to be the spiritual successor to it.
- [**Python for penetration testers**](https://vulnerablelife.wordpress.com/2017/05/13/python-for-penetration-testers/) If you are involved in vulnerability research, reverse engineering or penetration testing, I suggest to try out the Python programming language. It has a rich set of useful libraries and programs. This page lists some of them.

Most of the listed tools are written in Python, others are just bindings for existing C libraries, i.e. they make those libraries easily usable from Python programs.

### Books
- [**Burp Suite 实战指南**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/t0data/burpsuite/details) 本书主要实践方面的使用介绍，内容主要源于BurpSuite官方文档和多位国外安全大牛的经验总结，我只是在他们的基础上，结合我的经验、理解和实践.
